# **NYPD Data Analysis Project**

This project performs general data analysis on a given dataset. The database records all of the recorded NYPD's stop incidences and the details pertaining to each stop. Some of the items recorded include the description of the suspected crime, whether the officer was wearing a uniform, the suspect's demeanor, and the location of the stop and frisks. These incidents are recorded through an app that are then uploaded to the database. Data source: [NYPD's 2019 Stop, Question, and Frisk Database](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page) 

# Content
Main files in this project:
* [DataAnalysisProject(RATM).ipynb](https://github.com/DoddiC/DataAnalysisProject-RATM/blob/master/DataAnalysisProject(RATM).ipynb): This file loads the dataset and performs all the analysis mentioned below.
* [NYPD2019.csv](https://github.com/DoddiC/DataAnalysisProject-RATM/blob/master/NYPD2019.csv):  We do not own the dataset. The full .xls file is located at this url: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page. However, in order to assist setup of the .ipynb project, a preprocessed version has been added to the repository. 
* [README.md](https://github.com/DoddiC/DataAnalysisProject-RATM/blob/master/README.md):  This is a brief overview of the project repository. So references to files, techniques, concepts, and sources.

# Analysis techniques
The following techniques have been utilized to perform the analysis:
* Data Pre-processing
* Logistic Regression
* Demographic and Predictive Parity
* Matplotlib
